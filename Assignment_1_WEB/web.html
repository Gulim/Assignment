			<p>The first step of a little person on the road to growing up is getting an education. The child's future educational route depends on the choice of the place of study. My parents studied at <abbr title="Bilim-Innovation Lyceum">BIL</abbr>. That's why they knew what this school was like. Here, I first wanted to become an IT specialist. At our school, every month people from different fields were invited to motivate us. And at one such meeting came the Kazakh programmer Askhat Murzabaev, who earned more than $ 2 million after working for six months in the largest banking group Barclays (Great Britain). At the same time, the young specialist gave his entire fee to research on the fight against cancer. After his speech I wanted to become an IT specialist</p>

			<p>After some obstacles, I have to change school to Astana. Where I made some volunteer work and spend my final years in high school and finally decide to stay in IT sphere. I'm grateful for these two years away from home.</p>

			<p>The university presented unprecedented scale and diversity of opportunity. My first year of phenomenal professors across the disciplines pushed me to expand, challenge, and adjust my worldview.</p>
